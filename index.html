<p>Given a Graph G=(V,E), (V= Set of Nodes, E= Set of Edges), partition G into components i.e. subset of nodes, such that each subset is strongly interconnected with comparatively fewer edges across subsets.<br>
I have worked on a relaxation of the problem where I want to find a fixed number (say k) of connected components in G. In this context, I have done a comparative analysis of 2 classical algorithms - </p>

<ul>
<li>(a) Spectral Clustering of Graphs with Normalized Laplacian</li>
<li>(b) Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering of Graphs<br>
Algorithm (a) basically does a metric embedding of the graph into a K-dimensional subspace and run any standard data clustering algorithm(e.g K-means clustering) to identify the clusters in that subspace, and the nodes corresponding to those data points in each cluster are in fact the nodes belonging to the same component in the original graph. Algorithm (b) also does a metric embedding of the graph into a K-dimensional subspace and then keep on merging clusters which are highly "similar" into one larger cluster. The procedure is bottom-up and keeps on running until all data points are merged into a giant cluster. There are some popular notions of "similarity" measure that one can adopt to cluster points.</li>
</ul>

<a id="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h3>

<p>I wanted to study the behavior of these 2 algorithms on some benchmark datasets and find out on which set of graphs their outcome/performance will be same and on which other set their outcome/performance differs.</p>

<p>To see the results on the aforementioned datasets, execute the matlab scripts <em>run_G1.m</em>, <em>run_G2.m</em>, <em>run_Planted_L_Partition.m</em>, <em>run_SFI.m</em> and <em>run_ZKC.m</em> respectively. [Keep the directory structure as it is.]</p>
